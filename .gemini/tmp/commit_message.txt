feat: Add debug inputs and default GitHub token

This commit introduces the following changes to action.yml:
- The 'github-token' input is now marked as required and provides
  '${{ github.token }}' as a default value if not explicitly set.
  This ensures that a GitHub token is always available for the action.
- A new 'Debug Inputs' step has been added before the main action run.
  This step echoes the values of 'INPUT_GEMINI_API_KEY' and 'INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN'
  as environment variables, allowing for easier debugging of token transmission issues.
